<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  I’m an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for creating clean, functional, and visually appealing websites. Currently, I’m honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring responsive design and user-friendly layouts. My goal is to combine technical proficiency with creativity, turning ideas into fully functional digital experiences.

<p>Outside of coding, I’m fascinated by problem-solving and finding efficient solutions to challenges—whether it’s optimizing a website’s performance or enhancing the user interface. I’m committed to continuous growth in the tech field, and my ambition is to eventually master both front-end and back-end development, enabling me to build complete, dynamic web applications from scratch. Every line of code I write takes me one step closer to becoming a professional full-stack developer.</p>
